\chapter{Introduction}
Welcome to a latex thesis style for engineering students working on
their honours project. I'll illustrate how to perform certain cool
features of this thesis in the following text.

First thing to note. In order for things such as the table of
contents, references, and {\bf nomenclature} to work, you need to run
latex multiple times, including running biber (bibliography)
and makeindex (nomenclature). The command I use to make the
nomenclature is as follows:

{\tt
  makeindex thesis.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o thesis.nls
}

How you run these depends on whether you're on windows, Mac, or Linux,
so please google ``latex nomencl'' or ``latex biber'' and be sure to
add the platform (windows/mac/linux) and the editor (e.g., miktex) if
you're using one!

The second thing to note is that to start a new paragraph I just
leave at least one blank line in the text!

\section{Numbering of Sections, Tables, and Equations}
The first major benefit of Latex is that everything is numbered
automatically. You don't have to generate a table of contents,
figures, references or even a nomenclature. This is all handled
automatically.

\section{\label{sec:math} Mathematical Expressions}
An excellent feature of latex is its support for math. For example, we
can create an equation like so,
\begin{equation}
  y = mx+c.
\end{equation}
Notice how the equation is nicely formatted and numbered? Also notice
that the quation is punctuated like it is part of the sentence?
Referring to the equation number is easy as well. First, when we make
the equation we have to give it a label like so,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integralofc}
  a = \int c(x)dx.
\end{equation}
Then, in the text we can refer to it just by typing
Eq.~\ref{eq:integralofc} (see the thesis.tex file for what was
actually was done).

We can put labels anywhere, in figures, tables, chapters wherever, and
use the ref command to refer to them. For instance, this section is
Sec.~\ref{sec:math}. Notice the label just after the section command
above?

We can also write math inline. So for example I might say, our first
function is $y=mx+c$. 

There are a million math commands, so please take a look at the AMS
math package manual for more information. Here is an impressive 
equation to show off the features,
\begin{multline}
  \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \sum_{j}^n \left[ i{\mathcal
        L}^0_j - \sum_{k > j}^n {\mathcal T}(j,k) \right]\right)
  f({\Gamma}_1,\dots,{\Gamma}_n,t)
  \\
  = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \int {\rm d}{\Gamma}_{n+1}\, {\mathcal T}(j,n+1)\,
  f({\Gamma}_1,\dots,{\Gamma}_{n+1},t).
\end{multline}

\section{Adding Figures}
To add figures to your text, you need to use a series of commands, but
you can just copy paste the one below and tweak it for your needs.
\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[clip,width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/testfig}
  %You should always put a short caption in the [] for the table of figures
  \caption[A test figure..or is it]{\label{fig:testfig} A test figure. This
    caption is far too short. It should explain where the figure came
    from and exactly what it presents. Note how only a ``short''
    single-sentence caption appears in the table of figures though.}
\end{figure}

I can refer to this figure (Fig.~\ref{fig:testfig}) using the ref
command again, provided I've placed a label in the caption. But notice
how I don't get to choose where it is placed? I can only give hints,
via the [htp] option (which means either place it [H]ere, at the [T]op
of the page, or a whole [P]age). Latex is free to place it where it
thinks best. It knows better than you how to place figures too. If
they're not looking too good, maybe you have too little text, or the
figure is too wide/high. Remember, the text in the figure should at
least be as large as the text in the document, so don't shrink those
graphs too much.

The figure used here was drawn in Inkscape, an excellent free drawing
programme. Remember to save your images as PDF, and avoid using
jpg/png wherever possible (to keep the nice crisp vectorised graphics).

The one time we can be forceful about a figure is when we want it
placed on its own page by using the [p] placement. But if we're
doing a full-page figure we might want it rotated too to make sure we
fully use the space. See Fig.~\ref{fig:testfig2} for an example.
\begin{sidewaysfigure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[clip,width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/testfig}
  \caption{\label{fig:testfig2} A full page test figure and even the caption is rotated!.}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\section{Formatting Text}
You can format text in latex, but {\bf please use it sparingly!}. The
results {\em aren't always pleasant}. Use it only when you
\underline{really} want to.

\section{Using a Nomenclature}
To use a nomenclature you must add extra commands throughout your text
whenever you define a new term. For example, a handy acronym is MD
\nomenclature[A MD]{MD}{Molecular Dynamics}. 

The nomenclature command has 3 arguments. The last argument is the
description of the symbol/acronym. The second argument is the
symbol/acronym. The first is the type of entry it is (A=acronyms,
O=operator, V=Variables/Constants, S=Notation, and F is functions),
followed by a space then the alphabetical version of the term. For
example, if I wanted to define a greek symbol such as $\alpha$
\nomenclature[V alpha]{$\alpha$}{Alpha}, I would need to write alpha
here.

\section{Tables}

Tables are made in the following way...
\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{2cm}|||p{4cm}|p{2cm}|}
      Surface & $\varepsilon$ & Surface & $\varepsilon$ 
      \\\hline\hline%
      Asbestos, Board & 0.96 & Carbon, Candle soot & 0.95 \\
      Water & 0.95--0.96 & Carbon, Lampblack & 0.95\\
      Iron and steel, rough & 0.94--0.97 & Brick, Red, rough & 0.93\\
      White enamel paint & 0.906 & Iron and steel & 0.74\\
      Iron and steel, Sheet steel, oxidised & 0.657 & Oxidised Lead  & 0.28\\
      Iron and steel, Polished iron & 0.14--0.38 & Rough Aluminium & 0.06\\
      Polished Aluminium & 0.04 & Highly polished Gold & 0.02--0.35
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  %% In square brackets is the short caption name! Always use this if
  %% your caption is longer than one line in the list of tables!
  \caption[Typical values of the emissivity for various materials]{
    Typical values of the emissivity for various materials, 
    taken from Coulson \& Richardson, Vol.~1, Fig.~9.40.}
\end{table}

Just after the begin tabular command, the number of columns and their
alignments are selected. p means the column is a fixed width
paragraph, l c and r are a left aligned, centered and right aligned
columns respectively. The pipe character | adds vertical lines between
columns. Horizontal lines are added using hline commands in the table
itself.

We can also make full-page sideways tables when there is a lot of data
to present (see Table.~\ref{tab:BigTable})
\begin{sidewaystable}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{6.5cm}|p{2.0cm}|||p{4.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|}
      Surface & $\varepsilon$ & Surface & $\varepsilon$ 
      \\\hline\hline%
      Asbestos, Board & 0.96 & Carbon, Candle soot & 0.95 \\
      Water & 0.95--0.96 & Carbon, Lampblack & 0.95\\
      Iron and steel, rough & 0.94--0.97 & Brick, Red, rough & 0.93\\
      White enamel paint & 0.906 & Iron and steel & 0.74\\
      Iron and steel, Sheet steel, oxidised & 0.657 & Oxidised Lead  & 0.28\\
      Iron and steel, Polished iron & 0.14--0.38 & Rough Aluminium & 0.06\\
      Polished Aluminium & 0.04 & Highly polished Gold & 0.02--0.35
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  %% In square brackets is the short caption name! Always use this if
  %% your caption is longer than one line in the list of tables!
  \caption[Typical values of the emissivity for various materials (sideways)]{
    \label{tab:BigTable}Typical values of the emissivity for various materials, 
    taken from Coulson \& Richardson, Vol.~1, Fig.~9.40.
}
\end{sidewaystable}

\section{Footnotes}
Footnotes are really easy to do\footnote{And you can even put mathematics (even figures and tables) in them 
  \begin{align}
    f=m\,x+c
  \end{align}
  
  Just don't go crazy and write paragraphs and paragraphs of text in
  them. 
}.

\section{Referencing and Generating}
You can reference entries in your bib file using the key you have set
for it like so~\cite{Bannerman_2009}. I can even do cool things like
say the author of that citation is \citeauthor{Bannerman_2009} and it
was published in \citeyear{Bannerman_2009}. Or even ask for a full
citation, like so: \fullcite{Bannerman_2009}.

\section{Epigraphs}
\epigraph{{\em ``Epigraphs are cool!''}}{M.~Campbell Bannerman}

You can use epigraphs to include relevant information, such as quotes
or information on where the section/chapter was published.

\section{Hyperlinks}
Finally, we can even take advantage of the digital nature of our
document and include
hyperlinks. \href{https://marcusbannerman.co.uk/images/stories/pdfs/thesis.pdf}{
